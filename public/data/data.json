        "desc":"Matthew has been working in the creative technology field for over 20 years. His work has included campaign development, web development, web and poster design, motion graphics and social media campaigns. He's produced 2 feature length films and 20 plus short films garnering over 25 Official Film Festival selections. His web work has won 3 W3 Awards, a FWA Site of the Day, Communication Arts and Pixel Award.<br/><br/>Campaigns he has worked on include Spiderman, Disney's Cars, How to Train Your Dragon, Kung Fu Panda, Lego Atlantis, Fast and the Furious and for over 5 years his Wheel of Fortune game was advertised before the show while being distributed in over a dozen different markets worldwide. One of his favorite career moments is when his website for The Fast and Furious was advertised during a Final Four Game that his Michigan State Spartans were playing in. <br/><br/>For the past 10 years Matthew has been curating a blog of photoshopped images based on pop culture and political satire called, The Gallery of Infamy. He has been taking his Gallery work into AR Effects on Instagram and Facebook pages. A highlight for the gallery is when Al Roker retweeted a Game of Thrones mash up Matthew designed commenting on the blizzard taking over the east coast. <br/><br/>For the past 3 years he has been hosting a Poster Design forum for the Kapow Intergalactic Film Festival where he also handles the fest's web and social media presence. Last year he directed and recorded a live reading of the Winner for Best Comedy Screenplay, Elvis vs Buddy. Which will be released as an Audiobook later this year.<br/><br/>He has an encyclopedia knowledge of movie trivia, which his parents said will never make him any money, yet it does. Give him a line to a movie, he will probably know it."
